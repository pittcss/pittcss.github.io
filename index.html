      We are a research group at the
      <a href="https://xx">University of Pittsburgh</a>. Our
      mission is to understand human nature and society at scale.
    </p>
    <p class="f4 measure lh-copy">
      Society generates, and is shaped by, more data than ever before. This creates the opportunity to study human nature and society in new ways. Nearly every field of social science stands to be transformed by data. 
      <!-- Example research questions include:
      <ul>
        <li>How does information spread on social media?</li>
        <li>How can we create innovative teams of people?</li>
        <li>How is new technology shaping the economy?</li>
        <li>How do people organize around political issues?</li>

        <p class="measure lh-copy">
          From international trade to workers' career to team management, economic systems rely on structure.
          Mapping and studying these structures builds on traditional economics by identifying the path-dependence of out-of-equilibrium dynamics.
          For example, relating international exports reveals the growth of national economies, occupations' skill requirements determine cities' <a href="publications/2021_urbanResilience.html">economic resilience</a>, and employee interactions determine information spread across a company, innovation, and the workers who are most central to corporate structure.
          Research in this area is enabled by large-scale data and methodologies following a broad spectrum of inspiration, including from physics, ecology, and complex systems.

        <p class="measure lh-copy">
          Artificial Intelligence and machine learning (AI/ML) are increasingly used in public and private domains, ranging from business, public health, social services, to criminal justice, to assist in human decision-making. These AI technologies create tremendous ethical challenges in our society: biases are introduced in a number of ways through algorithmic decision-making aids, which can lead to biased outcomes, especially for minority populations and women. 
          Addressing such challenges requires multi-disciplinary efforts. Research in this area will synthesize and innovate theories from machine learning, model building, ethic and cultural studies, psychology and cognitive sciences and lay the foundation to successfully navigate and <a href="publications/2019_fairsight.html">evaluate responsible AI practices</a>.

        <p class="measure lh-copy">
          <!-- When Derek J. de Solla Price envisioned and founded scientometrics, he called it “Science of Science” to emphasize the vision of this new field as turning scientific curiosity and research methods onto ourselves to understand the properties, laws, and mechanisms of science. Price wasn’t doing this alone but worked together with allies from other disciplines, including Eugene Garfield, who created the current Web of Science, and Robert K. Merton, who laid the foundation of the sociology of science. Over time, significant focus on evaluative metrics, especially ones based on citation, have left some of the early questions understudied. Since then, with increasingly available data and computation, the time has ripened for this vision to be fully realized. The recent Science of Science revival has provided a new array of whys, wherefores, and know-hows to expand the scope and depth of scientometrics by integrating theories and methods from sociology, economics, management science, psychology, and beyond.  -->
          "Science of Science" aims to understand the properties, laws, and mechanisms of science creation. Over time, significant focus on evaluative metrics, especially ones based on citation, have become insufficient to capture the complexity of the evolution of science. With increasingly available data and computation, the recent Science of Science revival has provided a new array of whys, wherefores, and know-hows to expand the scope and depth of scientometrics by integrating theories and methods from sociology, economics, management science, psychology, and beyond.

        <p class="measure lh-copy">
          The ongoing pandemic marks the cusp of attention on how vulnerable people are being influenced by information distributed online. Problematic signals, from misinformation, disinformation, to polarized and biased messages, were seen to associated socially harmful attitudes and behaviors, such as discrimination and violence against disadvantaged, stigmatized or scapegoated groups. Research in this area attemps to understand all aspects of information ecosystem mediated by digital platforms, from powerful contents, vulnerable populations, to the chain of influence at scale.
