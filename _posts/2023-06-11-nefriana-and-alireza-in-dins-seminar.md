We are thrilled to share with you an exciting event that took place on March 23, 2023. Our esteemed members, Nefriana and Alireza, had the incredible opportunity to present their research at the University of Pittsburgh DINS Seminar Series. The seminar was attended not only by current SCI students but also by incoming PhD students who were eager to gain insights into the life of a PhD student in SCI. 

Nefriana and Alireza had the opportunity to share their research findings in this seminar series after their successful defense of their preliminary examination a week before, along with Yiling, who had also previously shared her research at the DINS seminar.
