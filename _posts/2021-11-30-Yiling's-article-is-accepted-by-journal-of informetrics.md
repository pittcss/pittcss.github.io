[Yiling's](https://lyl010.github.io/yilinglin/) recent work analyzed millions of research articles published over four decades to understand how yesterday's novelty forms today's scientific conventions, which condition the novelty-and surprise-of tomorrow's breakthroughs. 

This paper, titled "New Directions in Science Emerge from Disconnection and Discord," is accepted to be published by *Journal of Informetrics (JOI)*, a peer-reviewed journal which publishes high-quality research on quantitative aspects of information science. JOI's impact factor is 5.1 and ranks Q1 in Computer Science Applications, Library and Information Sciences, Management Science and Operations Research, and beyond. 

Before the final acceptance of this paper, Yiling had presented it across research groups and communities and triggered warmly discussions in [SciNLP 2021](https://scinlp.org/), [IC2S2 2021](https://ic2s2-2021.ethz.ch/), [Yi Bu's ](https://buyi08.wixsite.com/yi-bu) group at Peking University, [Bogdan Vasilescu's](https://bvasiles.github.io/) group at Carnegie Mellon University, and [Ying Ding's](https://yingding.ischool.utexas.edu/) group at the University of Texas at Austin.
