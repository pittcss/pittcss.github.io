Yiling's <a href="https://lyl010.github.io/yilinglin/">recent work</a> analyzed millions of research articles published over four decades to understand how yesterday's novelty forms today's scientific conventions, which condition the novelty--and surprise--of tomorrow's breakthroughs. This paper, titled "New Directions in Science Emerge from Disconnection and Discord," is accepted to be published by Journal of Informetrics, a peer-reviewed journal publishing high-quality research on quantitative aspects of information science (impact factor 5.1, Q1 in Computer Science Applications, Library and Information Sciences, Management Science and Operations Research and beyond). Before its final acceptance, Yiling presented this work and triggered warmly discussions across research groups and communities including <a href="https://scinlp.org/">SciNLP 2021</a>, <a href="https://ic2s2-2021.ethz.ch/">IC2S2 2021</a>, <a href="https://buyi08.wixsite.com/yi-bu">Yi Bu's group at Peking University</a>, <a href="https://bvasiles.github.io/">Bogdan Vasilescu's group at Carnegie Mellon University</a>, <a href="https://yingding.ischool.utexas.edu/">Ying Ding's group at The University of Texas at Austin</a>.
