Please use the usual Zoom link.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This Friday’s seminar presentation will be our first external talk given by Prof. &lt;a href=&quot;https://pdodds.w3.uvm.edu/&quot;&gt;Peter Sheridan Dodds&lt;/a&gt; (UVM). Peter will be presenting on “Ousiometrics and Telegnomics: Distant measurement of historical timelines, story turbulence, and essential meaning.” The talk will cover how to leverage collective utterances (e.g., tweets) to quantify societal well-being, cultural trends, and the emergence/spread of stories. 
Peter’s research focuses on system-level, big data problems in many areas including language and stories, sociotechnical systems, Earth sciences, biology, and ecology. Peter has created (and constantly evolves) a series of complex systems courses starting with Principles of Complex Systems. He co-runs the Computational Story Lab with Chris Danforth which is known for “blatantly fun research.”
For those interested, (completely optional) related background reading includes: Experimental study of inequality and unpredictability in an artificial cultural market (Science. aka the Music Lab study), The geography of happiness: Connecting Twitter sentiment and expression, demographics, and objective characteristics of place  (Plos ONE), and Human language reveals a universal positivity bias (PNAS)&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">First, this Friday’s seminar will occur at a slightly earlier time than normal: 11:45am-12:45pm.

This raises the question of how revolutionary theories and assumptions are evaluated and accepted into the norm of science as the setting for the next scientific revolution. Yiling’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://lyl010.github.io/yilinglin/&quot;&gt;recent work&lt;/a&gt; analyzed millions of research articles published over four decades and revealed the scarcity (~2%) of highly novel work, the higher chance (25%) they disrupt existing research rather than developing it, and its long-shot nature (it takes ten years or longer to recognize a novel work, over which period only 20% scholars survived). Yiling’s work also provides one of the first computational models reformulating Uzzi Atypicality, a prominent novelty measure in the Science of Science, as the distance across the latent knowledge spaces learned by neural networks. The evolution of this knowledge space characterizes how yesterday’s novelty forms today’s scientific conventions, which condition the novelty–and surprise–of tomorrow’s breakthroughs. This paper is accepted to present at &lt;a href=&quot;https://scinlp.org/&quot;&gt;SciNLP&lt;/a&gt;, a community aiming to bring together researchers from diverse fields who are interested in building computational systems that extract, represent the knowledge in scientific texts, and/or provide humans better access to such knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;
